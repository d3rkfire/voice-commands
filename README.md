# voice-commands
Inspired by CSGO in-game voice commands. This project allows you to do similar thing but in any other games. Technically, what this project does is that it captures global keyboard input and play the relevant voice commands.  

# Prerequiste
On its own, this project is no different from an audio player. However, with VB Audio Virtual Cable drivers installed, this project will automatically play the audio on VB-Audio's "Cable Input" which you can pipe to VB-Audio's "Cable Output" to work as a recording device like your microphone.
